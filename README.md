# UNITY_EATS: A Food Donation Flutter App

![App Screenshots](link_to_screenshot)

## Overview

UNITY_EATS is a mobile application designed to facilitate food donations from individuals and organizations to nearby NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) that help distribute food to those in need. This project aims to bridge the gap between food donors, NGOs, and administrators to streamline the donation process.

The app is divided into three main modules:

1. **Donor Module:** Donors can easily create listings for available food donations. They provide details about the food items, quantity, and pickup location. Donors can also view requests from nearby NGOs and accept or decline them.

2. **NGO Module:** NGOs can browse available food donations in their vicinity and request them for distribution to beneficiaries. Donors receive these requests and can choose to fulfill them.

3. **Admin Module:** Administrators have the authority to verify and approve new NGO registrations. Once an NGO is verified, it can start receiving food donations.

In the future, UNITY_EATS plans to expand its capabilities to include donations of other items such as clothes, books, money, toys, and more.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure user authentication and registration.
- **Donation Listings:** Donors can create detailed listings for available food donations.
- **Request System:** NGOs can request food donations from nearby donors.
- **Administrator Approval:** Admins verify and approve new NGO registrations.
- **Scalability:** Designed for future expansion to include various types of donations.
